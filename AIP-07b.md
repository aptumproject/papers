| 7b | Best Peer | Lucas Nestler | Standards | Peering | In Progress | 4th of July |

When always taking the peer with the lowest ping (and highest reputation when using eigentrust) and always pinging all new peers (with a reputation above X) when requesting peer lists from other peers, a node will slowly generate a ranking of the "best peers", allowing it to connect to only the best instead of random peers. This allows for faster data propagation in heavily asymmetrical systems, such as general server-user based communication. In a system like this, the high-speed servers would receive a higher ranking than slow yet honest nodes would, making it faster for the network to gossip data from one end to another by creating a "fast route". A design like this is well-depicted as a decentralised network (B) in this [image](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*nnpzTe1hx74WKICL3Gj34A.jpeg) and can be compared to highways that allow for faster traffic across large distances.
