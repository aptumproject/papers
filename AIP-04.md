Instead of having an inflation in the total supply by emitting new coins to the honest participats securing the network, a deflation punishing those who are not using their funds to vote may be used. The funds of every inactive node count as lost funds and may be reduced by 0.00001% every block (15s), resulting in a deflation of 25% for inactive nodes. Deflated coins are redistributed across actively participating nodes, to ensure that lost funds will be brought back into the system.
