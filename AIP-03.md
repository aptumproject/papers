| 3 | Delegates | Lucas Nestler | Standards | Consensus | In Progress | 4th of July |

### Description
Delegates are nodes with more than a certain percentage of the voting power. When making consensus through delegates, a vote is not needed but instead finality is instantly achieved after receiving one confirmation from one delegate. This proposal is independant from the underlying consensus algorithm, which could involve stake, work or capacity.
