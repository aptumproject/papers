By using stake as a requirement and as the resource to weight votes with, any attack has the requirement of owning a large portion of the currency and therefore is very unlikely to happen. Using currency as stake is a way to remove the second layer of hardware as seen in proof of work. One advantage of allowing everyone to stake is that everyone is allowed to cast a vote, everyone is allowed to be active. Potential disadvantages may be that finality is not instantly and chain-splits will happen and remain unresolved if a large player changes their online status.
