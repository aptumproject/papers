Reputation, a resource independent from the state and the networth of the chain, is a resource that is easily lost and hardly gained, making a secure and distributed consensus without any requirement other than being honest necessary. When using the eigentrust algorithm (see AIP-1: Eigentrust), badly behaving nodes can be slashed out of the consensus faster than they can with any other consensus mechanism while also being more attack-resistant.
