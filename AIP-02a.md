### Description
Masternodes are nodes with a colleteral of any kind, such as stake or reputation, with the permission to vote and participate in the consensus. Masternodes form a counter-proposal to AIP-02b: Stake. The advantage of using nodes with a constant-size burned stake is the enforced dedication to support the network. It is impossible to sell burned stake in any way, increasing the honesty of participating nodes, yet also reducing the quantity. With a reduced quantity of nodes hosted by the average person on their average internet connection with an average computer, the relative quality of nodes is increased as well, making consensus faster. Thanks to a constant participation cost per vote, votes do not have to be equalised either, making it possible to simply count the number of votes instead of calculating the cumulative stake that voted. Unfortunately the usage of masternodes also increases the barrier of being a participant, which removes buyable stake from the consensus, reducing the security of the network.
